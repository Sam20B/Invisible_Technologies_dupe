    <h3 class="ddresults">Result</h3>
    <p class="ddprobp">Delivery platform DoorDash was hit with a supply shock in March 2020, as restaurant dining was shut down due to the pandemic. Thousands of restaurants scrambled to be onboarded onto DoorDash, creating a backlog of menu-digitization that DoorDash's team could not handle alone.</p>
    <p class="ddsolnp">Invisible deployed a blend of people and technology to rapidly ingest huge amounts of unstructured data from vendors with humans in the loop, transforming over 1.5M data points per month with custom and off-the-shelf tooling.</p>
    <p class="ddresultsp">Onboarding improved by 233% and enabled expansion into three new markets. In the same period, DoorDash exploded their marketshare from 16% to 53%, while reducing onboarding costs by over 50%.</p>
